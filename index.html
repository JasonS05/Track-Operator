			<p>This is a game from the Minecraft mod Steve's Carts 2 for the 1.7.10 version of Minecraft. I do not claim any ownership of the ideas, artwork, design, textures, and so on present in this game. This is simply a recreation of the game on the web for ease of accessibility because I think it's a fun game that should be more accessible to the general public.</p>
