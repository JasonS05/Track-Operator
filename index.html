			<p>This is a game from the Minecraft mod Steve's Carts 2 for the 1.7.10 version of Minecraft. I do not claim any ownership of the ideas, artwork, design, textures, and so on present in this game. This is simply a recreation of the game on the web for ease of accessibility because I think it's a fun game that should be more accessible to the general public.</p>
			<p>This game is designed to be played on a desktop or laptop. Results on mobile devices may vary, and is not guaranteed to work at all.</p>
			<p>Instructions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Click on junctions to switch them.</li>
				<li>Steel junctions (darker colored rails) cannot be manually switched.</li>
				<li>Detector rails will switch junctions, including steel junctions.</li>
				<li>Hover over a detector rail to see which junctions it switches.</li>
			</ul>
